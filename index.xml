      <description>The 2018&amp;frasl;2019 &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Ignite | The Tour&amp;rdquo; global event recently completed in Mumbai.
The event took place in 17 cities around the world. Myself and other advocates joined forces with MVPs and Microsoft product specialists and experts to share current thinking around how to build amazing systems and services in the cloud and how to keep them up and running reliably.
In the coming weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a full retrospective on the event and the seven cities I had the pleasure of visiting while on tour.</description>

      <description>Christina and I first met during the Cloud Advocate Summit right after I joined the team at Microsoft. We had a full day of speaker training and were paired up on our first excercise.
Personally knowing only a handful of people on the team prior to joining, I had researched a few people on the roster, Christina quickly surfaced in my online searches.
Host of &amp;ldquo;This week on Channel 9&amp;rdquo;, Christina is one of the most knowledgable and charismatic people I know.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget my very first day on campus as a full-time Microsoft Azure Advocate.
Especially my first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; meeting with members of my team - a discussion around the process of updating documentation found on Microsoft Docs!
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it. Here I was sitting around a table with others reviewing how we could submit changes and new content to online resources used by so many.
Leading the conversation was Rick Claus.</description>

      <title>What A Long Strange Trip It&#39;s Been</title>

      <description>Just over four years ago, I impulsively responded to a Facebook post about a devops evangelism role at a new tech startup.
I had never been an evangelist and I knew nothing of the term “devops”. #yolo ¯_(ツ)_/¯
This spontaneous act illuminated a path of personal and professional growth.
A path that created new opportunities for me almost daily.
A path that changed me for the better.
A path that wasn’t there… until it was.</description>

      <description>On-call &amp;hellip; is a big resonsibility and heavy ask.
And as continuous delivery of digital products and services continue to become more common, developers are shouldering more of the &amp;ldquo;on-call&amp;rdquo; load then they are used to.
Here are Five Things Developers Can Use to Go On-Call (And Not Hate Their Life)
 For more of my thoughts on the role of &amp;ldquo;On-call&amp;rdquo; including incident resonse and retrospective analysis, check out this talk from Microsoft Ignite | The Tour</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago while in New York City to speak at QCon, my buddy and co-worker (Jay Gordon) was nice enough to let me take over his home office to record a podcast with the ITSM Crowd.
While I was there, we decided it made perfect sense to record an episode of his show &amp;ldquo;On-call Horror Stories&amp;rdquo;, of which I have plenty to reminisce over.
However, we decided to take a different approach to the conversation.</description>

      <description>IT Service Management (ITSM) &amp;hellip; and devops share many of the same high level objectives, but often diverge on approach and language.
Some of that is starting to change, however.
Check out the conversation I had with Claire Agutter, and Doug Tedder on Site Reliability Engineering and how organizations are finding common ground when they start to talk about desired outcomes and value.

      <description>In 2016, with the help of my amazing team at VictorOps, we put on the initial DevOps Road Trip - a series of events in several tech hubs around the U.S.
Starting off in Denver, we took our traveling event to Seattle, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and New York. Each of these free events were held at a unique and memorable venues.
In Denver, we invited attendees to Mile High Stadium (where the Denver Broncos play).</description>

      <description>When.. was the last time you got excited about new technology? What was it?
Was it a programming language?
Rust, Go, Node.js?
Maybe a new framework?
Angular, React?
Or was it something like serverless or containers?
Azure functions, Docker, Kubernetes?
Think back on what it was.
Do you have something in your mind?
Ok, now &amp;hellip;
How did you learn about it?
Likely from a friend or colleague introducing it to you, right?</description>
