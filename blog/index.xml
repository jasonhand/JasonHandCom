      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to check out some of the Microsoft Learn courses available over on Docs, drop what you&amp;rsquo;re doing and bookmark a few that catch your eye. They&amp;rsquo;re actually pretty decent and kinda fun.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working through several courses and documenting my thoughts and experience.
To kick things off I thought I&amp;rsquo;d start with one of the high level (read: non-technical) courses and then move on to some stuff around Databricks.</description>

      <title>How To Monitor Static Websites on Azure (With Rod Stewart)</title>
      <link>https://www.jasonhand.com/blog/monitoring-a-static-website-with-rod-stuart/</link>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s How I Setup Monitoring on My Site I recently changed this website from an App Service to a static site hosted in Azure Blob storage. So, the Application Insights (part of Azure Monitor) that I was previously using wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work any more.
Rather than try to reconfigure my existing instance, I decided a green field would be more interesting. And maybe even more challenging.
It was actually way simpler than I thought it would be.</description>

      <title>Five Things Developers Can Use To Go On-call (and Not Hate Their Life)</title>

As service reliability and uptime become increasingly more important for organizations building applications, developers are now being exposed to new responsibilities and challenges.
Tiered ticketing processes, Network Operations Centers (NOC), along with traditional change and incident management technicques can’t provide the level of response necessary to support rapidly deployed applications requiring high availability and maximum uptime.
Urgency of downtime in the modern era requires a different approach to building and maintaining digital systems and services.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago while in New York City to speak at QCon, my buddy and co-worker (Jay Gordon) was nice enough to let me take over his home office to record a podcast with the ITSM Crowd.
While I was there, we decided it made perfect sense to record an episode of his show &amp;ldquo;On-call Horror Stories&amp;rdquo;, of which I have plenty to reminisce over.
However, we decided to take a different approach to the conversation.</description>

      <description>IT Service Management (ITSM) &amp;hellip; and devops share many of the same high level objectives, but often diverge on approach and language.
Some of that is starting to change, however.
Check out the conversation I had with Claire Agutter, and Doug Tedder on Site Reliability Engineering and how organizations are finding common ground when they start to talk about desired outcomes and value.

Starting off in Denver, we took our traveling event to Seattle, Minneapolis, San Francisco, and New York. Each of these free events were held at a unique and memorable venues.
In Denver, we invited attendees to Mile High Stadium (where the Denver Broncos play).</description>

      <description>When.. was the last time you got excited about new technology? What was it?
Was it a programming language?
Rust, Go, Node.js?
Maybe a new framework?
Angular, React?
Or was it something like serverless or containers?
Azure functions, Docker, Kubernetes?
Think back on what it was.
Do you have something in your mind?
Ok, now &amp;hellip;
How did you learn about it?
Likely from a friend or colleague introducing it to you, right?</description>

      <description>Hands-down&amp;hellip; the most amazing experience of this year&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Ignite | The Tour&amp;rdquo; was riding along with Erik in a Ferrari 488 Spider through not only the streets of Milan but along Lake Como and up the mountain to the observatory.
Check out this video I made of the experience.
You&amp;rsquo;d be hard pressed to find anyone who knows more about Kubernetes than Erik and that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what he was in Amsterdam to talk about when we got another chance to hang out.</description>

      <description>Jay and I joined Microsoft around the same time and for a brief moment were even on the same team within the larger Cloud Advocacy team.
Every time we got to speak at the same stop on the Microsoft Ignite | The Tour, we tended to gravitate towards each other and despite vastly different tastes in music, we have a lot in common and it&amp;rsquo;s always good to catch up.</description>

      <title>What A Long Strange Trip It&#39;s Been</title>

      <description>Just over four years ago, I impulsively responded to a Facebook post about a devops evangelism role at a new tech startup.
I had never been an evangelist and I knew nothing of the term “devops”. #yolo ¯_(ツ)_/¯
This spontaneous act illuminated a path of personal and professional growth.
A path that created new opportunities for me almost daily.
A path that changed me for the better.
A path that wasn’t there… until it was.</description>

      <description>Small Problem - Large Cost On Wednesday, August 1st 2012 an 18 year old financial services firm began a test run of their new trading software.
Carefully configured to interact with a very small number of stocks and with Buy and Sell points set well outside where the markets were trading that day, a reasonable amount of caution was taken to reduce the blast radius in the unlikely event anything should go wrong.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll never forget my very first day on campus as a full-time Microsoft Azure Advocate.
Especially my first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; meeting with members of my team - a discussion around the process of updating documentation found on Microsoft Docs!
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it. Here I was sitting around a table with others reviewing how we could submit changes and new content to online resources used by so many.
Leading the conversation was Rick Claus.</description>

      <description>Neil and I had several really great trips together this year during the Microsoft Ignite | The Tour including a layover in Zermatt, Switzerland to snowboard the Matterhorn!
A wizard at Kubernetes and continuous deployment techniques with Azure Devops, I learn something new from Neil each time I see one of his talks.
Check out a couple of the talks Neil delivered while in Amsterdam this past March.

      <description>Ryan and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a ton of opportunities to work together so far, but each time we do chat I realize I have a lot to learn. One specific area I want to learn more from Ryan about is on the topic of Rust.
He gave a great internal presentation on the benefits of using Rust, especially from an Operations-work point of view. The increased security aspect of it is enough to take a closer look if you are a traditional C# developer.</description>

      <description>When you chat with Damien about literally any topic, you quickly realize YOU KNOW NOTHING .. and ALSO, he&amp;rsquo;s really REALLY good at explaining things.
If you have a few minutes, give the &amp;ldquo;Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Data&amp;rdquo; presentation from this past Microsoft Ignite | The Tour a watch. It was one of my favorites from the entire tour. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty crazy how easy it is to start using AI and Machine Learning to assist with different aspects of just about any business.</description>

Aside from behavorial economic theory, Ari and I have had the pleasure of connecting on several stops during the Microsoft Ignite | The Tour and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to teaming up with him on a few artificial intelligence projects - something I&amp;rsquo;m starting to explore more myself.</description>

      <description>The 2018/2019 &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Ignite | The Tour&amp;rdquo; global event recently completed in Mumbai.
The event took place in 17 cities around the world. Myself and other advocates joined forces with MVPs and Microsoft product specialists and experts to share current thinking around how to build amazing systems and services in the cloud and how to keep them up and running reliably.
In the coming weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a full retrospective on the event and the seven cities I had the pleasure of visiting while on tour.</description>

      <description>Notes about the &amp;ldquo;intro to data science in azure&amp;rdquo; Learn course:
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. This is a modeling technique for time series analysis that helps with predictions concerning time.
When you train a model, you need to split your data into training and testing sets so that you don&amp;rsquo;t train your model on all the data. When using time series data, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to split the data based on time.</description>
