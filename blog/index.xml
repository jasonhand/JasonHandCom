      <description>Just over four years ago, I impulsively responded to a Facebook post about a devops evangelism role at a new tech startup.
I had never been an evangelist and I knew nothing of the term “devops”. #yolo ¯_(ツ)_/¯
This spontaneous act illuminated a path of personal and professional growth.
A path that created new opportunities for me almost daily.
A path that changed me for the better.
A path that wasn’t there… until it was.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s a Static HTML Site? &amp;hellip; you may be asking yourself.
 It&amp;rsquo;s like the hip way to be old school, but in a new-skool kinda way!
 Nowadays, most websites contain both server-side and client-side (browser) scripts that are actively changing the content and properties of the website. Any e-commerce site is a good example of this.
Data is stored and delivered to the server and browser from a variety of sources and served up to the end-user dynamically as they navigate their way through the site.</description>
