<h3 id="how-to-devops-when-dev-doesn-t-want-to">How To DevOps When Dev Doesn&rsquo;t Want To</h3>

<p>So you’re on a DevOps team that is siloed from both Dev and Ops? And the Dev organization has no interest in continuing their DevOps transformation? A good DevOps Engineer is always pushing for improvements so stay tuned for tips on How To DevOps When Dev Doesn’t Want To.</p>

<p>Many companies start their DevOps journey by creating ‘a DevOps team’ but the transformation stalls there. They want all the benefits of CI/CD automation without putting in the work of a total DevOps culture transformation. So what do you do when this DevOps team wants to really drive DevOps change but Dev isn’t fully invested in the idea? We will discuss techniques for moving DevOps transformation forward even if all the parties are not fully participating in the transformation.</p>

<p><strong>Tips will include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a coalition of DevOps champions from across all the silos (dev, QA, Release Mgmt, Product Owners, Ops, etc.). While the senior management of any one silo may not be pushing for a DevOps transformation there are often grass roots efforts that can be enhanced.</li>
<li>Don’t call it DevOps … but keep making changes. Suggesting a full re-org to follow a Spotify model (tribes, squads) or suggesting that everyone become an SRE (Google) may not get much traction. But other models like TBM (Technology Business Management) or SAFe can be used to frame the discussion of cross-functional teams without ever using DevOps terminology.</li>
<li>Write it down. It’s amazing how many process changes dev will accept if they’re written down, especially if no counter process had been documented previously. This documentation often comes in the form of ‘acceptance criteria’ which define pre-requisites and standards that dev must meet before submitting new work to the DevOps team. Writing it down helps shift standardization to the dev side so DevOps team doesn’t have code around dev inconsistencies.</li>
<li>Blur the line between dev and ops with ‘self-help’ tooling. Often DevOps teams receive stories with requirements from dev to update a build, a cookbook, or a database. By making it easier for Dev to submit a PR for the update themselves and having DevOps team act as reviewers (instead of initiators) we can reduce handoffs and increase collaboration while shifting the line of ownership towards Dev.</li>
<li>Take baby steps. If the whole org is not bought into the idea of a DevOps transformation the process will take longer. That’s OK. It may be necessary to take baby steps to prove the value of DevOps culture in small areas before they’re willing to accept a full transformation.</li>
<li>Influence outside your lane … but be careful. It’s likely that upper management is skeptical of giving up their silo control and may see DevOps as intruding on their domain. By combining the tips above there are ways to make incremental changes without threatening the manager who wants to protect their turf.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-devops-goes-awry">When DevOps Goes Awry</h3>

<p>The DevOps culture claims to be a cure-all, a cloud of magic dust for all your problems. While that isn’t exactly true, what’s the worst that could happen? When your teams intend the best but the implementation isn’t well received, how do you recover your trust and heal the harm that has happened?</p>

<p>The DevOps culture claims to be a cure-all, a cloud of magic dust for all your problems. While that isn’t exactly true, where do we go from there? Teams in a DevOps culture often start with the best intentions but their implementations can be received as the worst. Let’s have an uncomfortable conversation about how things can sometimes go awry, and how we can recover trust and heal the harm.</p>

<p>This talk offers a blameless retrospective on patterns that many may have fallen into and some may have recovered from, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>ivory tower isolationism</li>
<li>firehose of unsolicited opinions</li>
<li>prescribed edicts</li>
<li>coercive testing methodology</li>
<li>highly speculative development</li>
<li>outsourcing emotional labor to junior engineers</li>
</ul>

<p>Presented by a panel of engineers who have been on the frontlines of DevOps cultures and experienced many sides of these problems, we’ll consider how to re-establish the bridge while being mindful of the consequences of the power dynamics that you exist in.</p>

<h3 id="navigating-the-service-mess-i-mean-mesh">Navigating the Service Mess&hellip; I Mean Mesh</h3>

<p>Service Mesh is a new buzzword in the microservices circles, but what is it? How does it work? Why do I even care? We’ll explore the evolution of microservice networking and why Service Mesh’s have come out as a tool to help manage such services.</p>

<p>In this talk we’ll explore what a Service Mesh is and how it relates to microservice technologies, but even more broadly heterogeneous cloud service deployments. Additionally, we’ll discuss how we got to the point why we need such technology in our modern technologies, why they are so useful with such deployments, and what makes a “good” service mesh.</p>

<h3 id="devops-diving-or-death-choose-2">DevOps, Diving, or Death: Choose 2</h3>

<p>This talk is a comparison between DevOps and cave diving, and how you can take strategies learned in one and apply it to the other. Cave diving is often considered one of the most dangerous sports in the world, yet some people still choose to participate in it and do so safely. DevOps pushes technology by making changes quickly, frequently, and often to large scale - isn’t moving fast and being on the cutting-edge risky too? The reality is everything we do has risks and challenges. Mitigating those risks and facing the challenges head-on can not only make activities safe, but also teaches valuable skills we can carry into other aspects of our lives. This talk looks at how we can take lessons and techniques used by cave divers and apply them to software development and DevOps, while aiming to inspire you to take your own hobbies and interests and use them to improve your work.</p>

<h3 id="you-should-waterfall-forever">You Should Waterfall Forever</h3>

<p>There is a hard wall between Dev and Ops, it should never be broken down. In the software world we build walls, and if the walls aren’t strong enough, we’ll switch to PHP and make them even higher, hairier. Sure containers look good on paper, but nobody really understands how the hell they work, there is no way they are a real thing, and you should DEFINITELY not trust your infrastructure to them. Production infrastructure works well in exactly one context, tested over six months and handed off cleanly to an ops team.</p>

<p>Developers shouldn’t waste their time understanding how all the pieces work together. Operations shouldn’t waste their time trying to understand what all those developers are thinking. They use Red Hat 4 and it works just fine.</p>

<h3 id="mission-impossible-prioritizing-devops">Mission Impossible - Prioritizing DevOps</h3>

<p>As individuals and organizations get tactical and start looking at specific capabilities to build and practices to embrace, the problem quickly becomes ‘How do I do all of this?’ and ‘Where do I get started?’. One aspect of this problem is how to create room for continuous improvement alongside supporting BAU, and the other is how do you prioritize and manage continuous improvement initiatives against each other. While improving something is better than not improving anything at all, it’s important to demonstrate quick wins to build momentum and get others excited about the DevOps journey. This talk explores into the various ways of prioritizing DevOps initiatives and helps answer questions like ‘Which problem should I focus on fixing?’, ‘Which capability should I build first?’, and ‘Which application team should I pick as pilot?’</p>

<h3 id="product-management-and-devops-together-at-last-and-kicking-butt">Product Management and DevOps, Together at Last and Kicking Butt</h3>

<p>The good, bad and ugly of how Sendgrid is incorporating Product Management practices into planning and execution within their DevOps and Platform teams to cut off scope creep, never ending projects and realizing value for internal teams.</p>

<p>Dev Ops and Platform teams have too many projects, not enough time and users who are an email, message or quick walk away to tap you on the shoulder to ask if that thing is done because it is really holding them up from completing something for real this time. We will talk through some tried and true product management practices that will help solve the problems of never ending projects, squeaky wheels that demand priority and projects that flop on launch.</p>

<p>We will talk at a high level about some common product practices and the experience of introducing those at Sendgrid in the Tech Ops org.</p>

<ul>
<li>Validating problems through customer interactions</li>
<li>Using story maps to get to first and fast release</li>
<li>Launching products for adoption</li>
<li>Getting user feedback and incorporating it into the backlog</li>

<li><p>Sunsetting a product</p>

<h3 id="so-you-work-with-an-asshole">So, You Work With An Asshole</h3>

<p>Many aspects of human behavior are contagious in a sense. You’re more likely to laugh at something if others around you are also laughing. The same can be said about being an asshole. If your boss is an asshole, they are more likely to hire others onto their teams that perpetuate asshole behaviors. This leads to toxic work environments where amazing talent leaves, or suffer from physical and psychological illness. So - how do we identify true assholes from someone that is just having an off day? What can we do about assholes in our work environment, can it be changed or is it time to leave? What can we do if we notice that we are becoming the kind of asshole we always despised? Using suggestions directly backed by scientific research across multiple countries, we can learn how to handle these situations and become more self-aware to prevent this type of behavior from continuing in the workplace. This is highly relevant to the tech industry, due to the fact that your jobs require high levels of creativity and cognitive processing, which are both stifled by working in asshole ridden work places.</p>

<h3 id="be-a-rising-tide-and-lift-all-the-boats">Be a Rising Tide and Lift All the Boats!</h3>

<p>Want to be successful in your career? Help others be successful, and so will you. “Teach a man to fish”, “you reap what you sow”, “be a fountain, not a drain” – choose your favorite metaphor. I prefer to think of myself as “boat lifter”, helping everyone around me get better. And as a result, I get better, too.</p>

<p>This is critical for our success as individuals, and also for our teams, organizations, and projects. None of those can reach its full potential unless we’re helping each other learn and grow. Anyone at any level can do this.</p>

<p>I’ll share some ideas I’ve picked up during my 15-year career in the service provider and SaaS industry to help you be a boat lifter. Both technical and cultural, you’ll leave with tips for impacting those around you for good.</p>

<h3 id="open-source-developers-are-security-s-new-front-line">Open Source Developers are Security&rsquo;s New Front Line</h3>

<p>As vital as open source is to building software in today’s world, it’s a mistake to think of it as a silver bullet. The ability to change the world with it is clear - but so is the significant room for error, when not properly managed.</p>

<p>A shifting battlefield of attacks based on OSS consumption has emerged. Five years ago, large and small enterprises alike witnessed the first prominent Apache Struts vulnerability. In this case, Apache responsibly and publicly disclosed the vulnerability at the same time they offered a new version to fix the vulnerability. Despite Apache doing their best to alert the public and prevent attacks from happening — many organizations were either not listening, or did not act in a timely fashion — and, therefore, exploits in the wild were widespread. Simply stated, hackers profit handsomely when companies are asleep at the wheel and fail to react in a timely fashion to public vulnerability disclosures.</p>

<p>Since that initial Struts vulnerability in 2013, the community has witnessed Shellshock, Heartbleed, Commons Collection and others, including the 2017 attack on Equifax, all of which followed the same pattern of widespread exploit post-disclosure.</p>

<p>Shift forward to today - and hackers are now creating their own opportunities to attack.</p>

<p>This new form of attack on our software supply chains, where OSS project credentials are compromised and malicious code is intentionally injected into open source libraries, allows hackers to poison the well. The vulnerable code is then downloaded repeatedly by millions of software developers who unwittingly pollute their applications to the direct benefit of bad actors. In the past 18 months, no less than 12 real-world examples of this attack pattern have been documented.</p>

<p>It’s becomes clear that we are in the middle of a systematic attack on the social trust and infrastructure used to distribute open source. In just a few years, we’ve gone from attacks on pre-existing vulnerabilities occurring months after a disclosure down to two days - and now, we are at the point where attackers are directly hijacking publisher credentials and distributing malicious components.</p>

<p>Open source developers are the front line of the new battle. Attackers have recognized the power of open source and are seeking to use that against the industry. We must not let them ruin the reputation of the things we’ve built. Or worse, the entire open source ecosystem.

<h3 id="no-more-flaky-tests-building-trust-in-your-automated-tests">No More Flaky Tests: Building Trust in Your Automated Tests</h3>

<p>For many DevOps teams, their CI server has become just like the young shepherd-boy in the famous Aesop fable where he would cry wolf to falsely alarm the village to save their sheep. When the build is broken due to flaky automated tests, the team loses faith in the tests. How do we build the trust?</p>

<p>For many DevOps teams, their continuous integration builds have become just like the young shepherd-boy in the famous Aesop fable where he would cry wolf to falsely alarm the village to save their sheep. When the build breaks, team members assess the build. Yet, time and time again, they find that the application is working but that the tests are faulty and giving false alarms. Eventually, no one pays attention to the alerts anymore and lose faith in what was supposed to be a very important indicator. In this talk, I’ll explain how to save the sheep or in this case, the quality of the application. By following 5 steps to build stability within continuous integration tests, we can manage the automated tests that are failing and influence the perception of the credibility of the tests among stakeholders.</p>

<h3 id="zero-to-sre">Zero to SRE</h3>

<p>Being able to transform a junior engineer into an excellent mid, then senior engineer is a competitive advantage for any company. During this talk, I will describe strategies to train and support junior devops engineers.</p>

<p>Being able to transform a junior engineer into an excellent mid, then senior engineer is a competitive advantage for any company. Unfortunately, there aren’t many entry-level SRE job postings, and if your company hasn’t hired juniors before, you’ll need to make changes in order to create an environment where they can thrive.</p>

<p>This talk is the story of a junior Web Developer turned SRE. I’ve been able to successfully transition into my role because my company has embraced junior engineers by creating a ‘Culture of Error,’ encouraging all engineers to be mentors, and ensuring that all employees take time during the day to learn new skills. We’ve made some mistakes, too, but we’ve learned a lot in the process.</p>

<p>By end of this talk, I’ll share the specific details of how to support junior engineers during their first day, month, 90 days and year, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to create a learning plan with your junior engineer on their first day</li>
<li>Strategies for getting your new engineer to contribute to your code base or infrastructure during their first week</li>
<li>How to use the study technique “active recall” and a knowledge wiki to accelerate your junior engineer’s learning trajectory</li>
<li>A description of the company-wide attitudes and mindsets that have allowed these practices to flourish</li>
</ul>
